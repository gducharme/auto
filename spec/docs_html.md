# Docs HTML
The `docs/html` directory stores HTML copies of posts that are ready for publication. Medium's import feature requires a URL, so these pages provide a static location when publishing.

```json
{
  "title": "docs_html",
  "description": "HTML posts prepared for Medium import",
  "type": "object"
}
```
