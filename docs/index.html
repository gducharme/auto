  <h2>I. Introduction: The Return of Violence as Form</h2>
  <p>Flashes on screens. Signatures detected. Calibrations
  complete. Another carefully curated kinetic event registers
  across the global nervous system. A facility struck in Iran. A
  bridge interdicted in Crimea. A drone swarm intercepted over the
  Red Sea. These are real incidents, producing real debris, real
  casualties, real terror for those on the ground unfortunate
  enough to be caught within the designated performance zone. Yet,
  for the observer removed by distance or by the sterile interfaces
  of modern information flows, they arrive less as chaotic
  eruptions of war and more as scheduled transmissions. Data points
  in a system undergoing percussive maintenance.</p>
  <p>We are, it seems, required to witness these events. Not
  because they necessarily signal an imminent, existential
  escalation (though that risk is perpetually managed in the
  background), but because they function <em>as</em> signals. These
  are not the overwhelming barrages of total war, nor the messy,
  diffuse insurgencies that seek to unravel the state entirely.
  These are precise, measured, often telegraphed applications of
  force, bearing less resemblance to the storming of a city than to
  the striking of a bell â€“ loud, resonant, and intended to be heard
  across a specific domain of meaning.</p>
