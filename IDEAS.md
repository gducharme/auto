# IDEAS

Some brainstorming ideas for extending the project:

- Add support for additional social networks like Twitter or LinkedIn for cross-posting.
- Implement a dashboard to monitor ingestion and publish status per post.
- Provide a scheduling interface to control when posts are published to each network.
- Integrate with a content moderation service to filter posts automatically before publishing.
- Add notifications for failed publish attempts via email or messaging apps.
